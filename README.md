TODO:
1. Create the deck selection screen (and make it interactable).
2. Write a script so that when you hover the card text and scroll, then it scrolls the text so we can overflow text inside the card effect box. Also make the overflow card text invisible via mask.
3. Add sparkles to the secret rare material.
4. Redesign the card effect box of the cards.
